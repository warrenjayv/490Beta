  autogradermid is being updated to ensure that feedback is properly returned when
  invalid functions are provided by the student. the code needs to ensure that
  characters are escaped when sending SQL statements.

  [-] task A -- escape SQL variables 
      
      report A -- the autograder will now update feedback if the function student provides
      fails to match testcases.

      addT was checked to ensure that it escaped 'text' answer before curling backend.
      addT and the autograder is ready to be coordinated together for further testing.

LOG Sun Mar 31 09:33:34 EDT 2019
   
  brief: the autograder is tested. updated getAnswer() to ensure proper testcases
  are associated with the proper question when sent to the autograder. last test
  shows that exec will fail if the student answer function does not match the testcases.

  [-] task A -- when exec fails, mark it for failure, and deduct points. 

LOG Sun Mar 31 07:43:37 EDT 2019

  tested the autograder with testId 2 with 2 questions and it failed
  because it inserted the wrong testcase in the python file.

  [-] task A -- investigate why it is acting this way and fix it. 

  [-] reports

     task A report - Sun Mar 31 08:27:54 EDT 2019
       python failed to exec because there were no answers in the test.
       insert a sample answer and run the test again. 
  
     task A report - Sun Mar 31 08:12:46 EDT 2019
       investigation shows that php exec failed to execute the python
       file. 

     task A report - Sun Mar 31 08:53:49 EDT 2019
        autolog.txt report shows that the getAnswers() function returned
	the wrong testcase for a given question Id. 

     task A COA - Sun Mar 31 08:56:48 EDT 2019
        the issue was found in getAnswers(). it is not clearning the
	array for each question, thus adding testcases to previous 
	array. clearing it for every loop and conducting test again. 

LOG Sat Mar 30 23:00:34 EDT 2019

  the autograder should now be tested with 2 additional questions.

  [-] task A -- use an additional test with additional questions and ensure it
  it properly works. 

  [-] task B -- be able to change points in the addT functionality.
  
  
LOG Sat Mar 30 17:18:38 EDT 2019

  invalid questionIds are being passed to backend from the front and need
  to be reprocessed. 

  [-] task A -- ensure that addT prevents inadvertent inserts of invalid
  questions. 

  [-] report A -- addT (MakeTest2.php) will now filter question Ids. It will 
  still create the test, but no questions will be associated with it, 
  it will return an error in its JSON response.
