  invalid questionIds are being passed to backend from the front and need
  to be reprocessed. 

  task A -- ensure that addT prevents inadvertent inserts of invalid
  questions. 

  report A -- addT (MakeTest2.php) will now filter question Ids. It will 
  still create the test, but no questions will be associated with it, 
  it will return an error in its JSON response.
